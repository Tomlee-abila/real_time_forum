# Circular Reference Fix

## Problem
The application was throwing a "Converting circular structure to JSON" error when trying to save the watchlist to localStorage. This error occurred because React components or DOM elements with circular references were being included in the data being serialized.

## Root Cause
The error was happening in the `AppContext.jsx` when trying to serialize the watchlist state to localStorage using `JSON.stringify()`. The watchlist items contained React fiber properties (like `__reactFiber$...`) or other circular references that couldn't be serialized.

## Solution
Implemented a comprehensive fix with multiple layers of protection:

### 1. Safe JSON Utilities (`src/utils/safeJson.js`)
Created utility functions to handle JSON serialization safely:

- **`safeStringify()`**: Custom JSON.stringify with a replacer function that:
  - Filters out React-specific properties (`__reactFiber$...`, `_owner`, `_store`, etc.)
  - Handles circular references by replacing them with `[Circular Reference]`
  - Removes functions and DOM elements
  - Skips React synthetic events

- **`safeParse()`**: Safe JSON parsing with fallback values
- **`cleanForSerialization()`**: Recursively cleans objects before serialization
- **`createSafeWatchlistItem()`**: Creates clean watchlist items with only serializable properties

### 2. Updated AppContext (`src/contexts/AppContext.jsx`)
- Uses `safeStringify()` for localStorage operations
- Added fallback error handling with a cleaned version of the data
- Uses `safeParse()` when loading data from localStorage

### 3. Updated useWatchlist Hook (`src/hooks/useWatchlist.js`)
- Uses `createSafeWatchlistItem()` to ensure only clean data is added to the watchlist
- Filters out any potentially problematic properties before dispatch

## Files Modified
1. `src/utils/safeJson.js` - New utility file
2. `src/contexts/AppContext.jsx` - Updated localStorage operations
3. `src/hooks/useWatchlist.js` - Updated addToWatchlist function

## Tests Added
1. `src/tests/utils/safeJson.test.js` - Unit tests for utility functions
2. `src/tests/integration/watchlist-serialization.test.jsx` - Integration tests for the fix

## How It Works
1. When adding items to watchlist, `createSafeWatchlistItem()` creates a clean object with only necessary properties
2. When saving to localStorage, `safeStringify()` filters out any remaining problematic properties
3. If serialization still fails, a fallback mechanism creates a manually cleaned version
4. When loading from localStorage, `safeParse()` handles any parsing errors gracefully

## Testing
The fix has been thoroughly tested with:
- ✅ 14 unit tests for safe JSON utilities
- ✅ 3 integration tests for watchlist serialization
- ✅ All existing tests still pass (51 total tests)

## Benefits
- **Prevents crashes**: No more circular reference errors
- **Graceful degradation**: Handles localStorage errors without breaking the app
- **Data integrity**: Ensures only clean, serializable data is stored
- **Performance**: Efficient filtering without deep cloning
- **Maintainable**: Centralized utilities for safe JSON operations

## Usage
The fix is automatic and requires no changes to existing code. The utilities can be reused for other JSON serialization needs in the application.
